/*
** This program calculates the occupancy rate for a hotel
**
** The program asks the user for the number of floors, then iterates through each
** floor asking the user to input the number of rooms on the floor and how many
** are occupied
**
** After all iterations the program displays the total number of rooms, how many
** are occupied/unoccupied, and the % of rooms that are occupied
**
** Because many hotels do not have a 13th floor the program skips it
** The hotel cannot have less than 1 floor
** each floor cannot have less than 10 rooms
